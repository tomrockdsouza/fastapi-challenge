# Python Backend Test

This is a Python backend test for HelloFresh candidates to evaluate their programming skill.

## Goal

Nowadays, the Microservice Architecture Pattern has been widely used. However, it has several drawbacks and it can be challenging to implement it.

The goal of this test is to assess (to some degree) your coding and architectural skills building robust and reliable systems.

You're given a problem so you can focus on showcasing development techniques.

The image below presents a diagram that describes the problem.

## Prerequisites

- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)


## Requirements

In this test, you need to implement one microservice:

- [Order Service Requirements](docs/order-service.md)


These are some aspects you should pay particular attention to:
- You MAY use any framework and ORM you prefer.
- Your application MUST run within the containers. Please provide short setup instructions.


## Use Cases
Both [Product Service](docs/product-service.md) and [User Service](docs/user-service.md) have some faulty behavior for specific products and users. When testing the use cases below, be aware of them.

#### Create Order #1
```json
{
    "user_id": "7c11e1ce2741",
    "product_code": "classic-box"
}
```

#### Create Order #2
```json
{
    "user_id": "7c11e1ce2741",
    "product_code": "family-box"
}
```

#### Create Order #3
```json
{
    "user_id": "7c11e1ce2741",
    "product_code": "veggie-box"
}
```

#### Create Order #4
```json
{
    "user_id": "e6f24d7d1c7e",
    "product_code": "classic-box"
}
```

#### Create Order #5
```json
{
    "user_id": "e6f24d7d1c7e",
    "product_code": "family-box"
}
```

#### Create Order #6
```json
{
    "user_id": "e6f24d7d1c7e",
    "product_code": "veggie-box"
}
```


## Evaluation Criteria
- Extensibility and readability of the code
- How the files and folders are organized in the filesystem
- Resilience of the service towards third party failures
- Testing suite
- Documentation of design process in the PR description


## Bonus criteria
- Use of asyncio library and asynchronous patterns
- Metrics
- Fault tolerance mechanisms regarding RabbitMQ broker downtime


## Submission instructions

We expect that the assignment will not take more than 3 - 4 hours of work. In our judgement we rely on common sense and do not expect production ready code. We are rather instrested in your problem solving skills and command of the programming language that you chose.

The test needs to be submitted as a pull request to this repository so we can leave reviews and have discussion about the application.

### Steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Checkout to a new `dev` branch
3. Once done, create a PR in this repository but don't merge it

**Lastly, but very important, have fun!**
